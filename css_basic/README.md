# ALX Intro to SWE "HTML and CSS Project"

This project is a part of the ALX task done by me and focuses on building a basic website using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the homepage of the website.
- `tweets.html`: Displays a specific embedded tweet.
- `styles.css`: Defines the styles and layout of the website.
- 'base.css

## Getting Started

To view the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Abmilro3/alx_html_css.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd alx_html_css`
3. Open the `index.html` or `tweets.html` file in a web browser.

## Additional Features
